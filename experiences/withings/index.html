<p>Internship ‚úÖ <br>
February 2016 - August 2016</p>

<h1 id="french-touch">French Touch</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.withings.com">Withings</a> might be one of France&rsquo;s finest companies. Founded by serial entrepreneur Eric Carreel (who also founded Inventel, Scuplteo, Zoov&hellip;) their products have always pioneered in the health connected devices field. Their historic connected scale has enlightened the way for many more successful products such as watches, sleep monitors etc&hellip; <br></p>

<p>During my internship I had the opportunity to work on the Steel HR connected smart watch along with <a href="X">Manon Navellou</a>. While she was in charge of the whole watch electronic integration and heart features I was responsible for the design and and design to manufacturing of the watch case and wristband.</p>

<h1 id="from-c-to-w">From C to W</h1>

<p>Working with designers, Chinese partners for production, other mechanical engineers was humbling. Taking the time to embrace every party&rsquo;s standpoint in order to make things move in the right direction might have been the single most important takeaway I could get from this experience. <br>
Among other things, I had the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
<li>translate designer&rsquo;s concepts into production-ready products. 2 wristbands models, 1 steel case</li>
<li>work closely with Chinese manufacturing engineers to define production processes and specifications</li>
<li>travel to China to assist the main engineer in the assembly line creation process (I  should, write a full article about that trip itself considering the mind-blowing experience it was!</li>
</ul>

<p>To be completely honest, until recently that was the professional achievement I was the most proud of. The whole product started selling in October 2016 meaning that I had my first engineered product on people&rsquo;s wrists at age 23! üí™</p>

<h4 id="s-o">s/o</h4>

<p>This section is bit special as this experience was very rich for me both professionally and personally. Doing peer-validated work is not the only key to success, but needs to be doubled by team spirit and respect. <br>
So a big thank you to
