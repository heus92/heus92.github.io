      <description>I know it might seem a bit weird to imagine a freelance product manager. Of course for pure tech,product oriented companies such a position often does not make sense but not all companies are mature tech startups üòÖ
This is why I&amp;rsquo;m looking at making an impact along side two kind of teams
 companies with a low-tech core business looking into entering the digital work üå± small motivated and ambitious small teams trying to shape their first product üöÄ  In both cases the aim is to reach out in the best possible way to your first users and maximize for impact and that&amp;rsquo;s where things get interesting!</description>

Started from the bottom&amp;hellip; Heetch is one of Uber&amp;rsquo;s French competitor. Basically the app offers a more social and fun experience than what Uber can offer with a very premium, high end service.
I joined in January 2018 as a Junior Ride Product Manager with Walid Ellec as a mentor. During those first months I shipped my first user facing features and started getting ahead of what being a PM meant.</description>

      <description>Status Side project üöß November 2017 - &amp;hellip;
Intro I&amp;rsquo;d say that project mixes two of the most important things I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered in my whole life: rap music and education. For those of you who already read a bit about my previous Deepdives project this is basically the personal spinoff I made from it. For the others, let&amp;rsquo;s meet below.

      <description>Status Personal Project ‚ò†Ô∏è February 2017 - September 2017
Intro This is part 2 (and last) of my entrepreneurial adventure with the amazing Charlotte Moreau. The first part is our attempt at launching Nabu&amp;rsquo;s sign language translation wristband.
After Class This project&amp;rsquo;s objective was pretty simple: how could one keep learning about new subjects without being feeling old-school-taught or bored?
We started with a first iteration as a messenger bot called Charade (try it out üá´üá∑).</description>

Intro This article is the first part of a 2 article-long adventure with the amazing Charlotte Moreau. I will write a dedicated article about the human adventure itself but let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the product and achievements for now.
Go Bears! When I left Paris for UC Berkeley (with a bricked computed) I never knew the &amp;ldquo;Jedi wristband&amp;rdquo; project I was bringing with me would follow such an amazing path.</description>
