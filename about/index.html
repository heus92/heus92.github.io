      <h1>About Me 👋</h1>
    </header>

    

<p>My name is Rashad but you already knew that, didn&rsquo;t you? Basically I&rsquo;m a <strong>product addict</strong>. I love digging around into all sort of fun and incredible products I can find. From the ones I use everyday to my friends&rsquo; startup projects or even low tech random hardware from the 90s&rsquo; I find on the streets, <strong>every product has something to teach us</strong> so let&rsquo;s find out!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always eager to collaborate with new people on new (or old) subjects to <strong>deliver great value</strong> to people in the world. From youngster looking for a ride, to African migrants starting a new life in France everyone deserves a great product. Let&rsquo;s build that together!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m available for all kind of product-related missions. I&rsquo;m more about the outcome and the project than the title of being a product-whatever-manager or a data-bs-specialist. So if your project is about making the world a better place I&rsquo;m waiting for you!</p>

<p>At that moment you should be wondering if I&rsquo;m full of BS or if I&rsquo;m the right product guy you&rsquo;re looking for. Instead of keeping you bored here I&rsquo;ve written a special post on <a href="https://rashad.pm/articles/product-vision/">My Product Vision 🌠</a> and I&rsquo;d like to invite you on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashadkaranouh/"><strong>my LinkedIn profile</strong></a> as well.</p>

<p>Shoot me an <a href="mailto:rashad.karanouh@gmail.com"><strong>email</strong> 📧</a> or directly <a href="https://calendly.com/rashad-karanouh/coffee"><strong>book a slot</strong> 📅</a> for us to chat now! Can&rsquo;t wait to hear from you 🤜🔥🤛</p>

<h1 id="education">Education 🤓</h1>

<p>I had the chance to attend many different and prestigious schools. Here&rsquo;s a quick summary</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>MSc Innovation &amp; Technology Entrepreneurship</strong> - <em>Ecole Polytechnique, Paris (2016-2017)</em><br />
Best French engineering school. This master is made to spur engineers to draw a line between science and the startup world as a source of innovation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Learn2Launch Certificate</strong> - <em>UC Berkeley, San Francisco  (2016)</em><br />
6 months in San Francisco, CA, learning and mostly failing on startup projects. I launched the NABU wristband that won <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> awards. Highest Honors.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>MSc Mechanical Engineering &amp; Materials Science</strong> - <em>Ecole des Ponts, Paris  (2013-2018)</em><br />
Top 4 engineering school. Modelisation. CAD. Industrial manufacturing processes. 3D printing. Initiated the creation of many teaching modules such as prototyping and foundery.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="languages">Languages 🌍</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>🇫🇷 <strong>French</strong> <em>Wesh bien ou bien?</em><br />
Duh&hellip; born and raised Paris what else could I say ?</p></li>

<li><p>🇺🇸 <strong>English</strong> <em>What&rsquo;s uppppp?</em><br />
Hopefully that website isn&rsquo;t full of mistakes and will show you how that my English is not too bad despite French people&rsquo;s reputation.</p></li>

<li><p>🇱🇧 <strong>Arabic</strong>  <em>kifak 7abibi?</em> <br />
I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have immigrants parents who taught me to speak Arabic at home. As you may know, every Arab country has its own dialect. As for me I&rsquo;m fluent in Lebanese Arabic and Algerian Arabic with some notions of Tunisian Arabic</p></li>

<li><p>🇪🇸 <strong>Spanish</strong> <em>¿Como estás mi amor?</em><br />
Joke aside, I learned and loved learning Spanish at school. Not (yet) fluent but definitely a good level.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="programming">Programming 💾</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Backend dev</strong><br />
Python skills mainly. I first started with <a href="https://stackshare.io/django">Django framework</a> to release the former version of Rapsodie (called Rapacademix at the time). Since then, I learned some <a href="https://stackshare.io/flask">Flask</a> skills to launch projects way faster and test my ideas asap.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Data Science</strong><br />
Beyond my engineering data analysis and data viz skills, I&rsquo;m working to expand my practical knowledge to data science and machine learning. This gets even better when I get to apply my Python skills to make great data patterns standout!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Frontend dev</strong><br />
I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Boostrap</a> for a couple of years and know some basic but useful stuff with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. It comes in handy to spawn or test an idea quickly.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><em>Of course I&rsquo;ll never be as proficient as any specialist on those topics but the aim is to be as independent and efficient on many subjects as a PM to test, learn and move forwards on any project.</em></p>

<!-- # Random skills 🔮

+ **Hardware prototyping**\
    Even I tend to forget that I spent 2 years creating hardware products. From 3D printing, to CAD, welding, or Arduino programming I developped a set of handy skills that help kickstart projects.

+ **Photoshop**\
  You never know what's coming at you. Whether it's a Slack custom emoji, your friends' wedding, a facebook profile picture, or a Spotify playlist cover you have to be ready.  -->
