      <description>There are a lot of people talking about product out there. Like a lot. How do you know I&amp;rsquo;m the one you need for your amazing secret project? Well let me introduce you to my product vision.
What the f*** is &amp;ldquo;product&amp;rdquo; anyway? Basically anything you&amp;rsquo;re serving your users is product-related. The obvious part is made of UX and UI design of course but not only, your tech stack and the way you use your data (if any) change make go from a meh product to a great product!</description>

      <description>I know it might seem a bit weird to imagine a freelance product manager. Of course for pure tech,product oriented companies such a position often does not make sense but not all companies are mature tech startups üòÖ
This is why I&amp;rsquo;m looking at making an impact along side two kind of teams
 companies with a low-tech core business looking into entering the digital work üå± small motivated and ambitious small teams trying to shape their first product üöÄ  In both cases the aim is to reach out in the best possible way to your first users and maximize for impact and that&amp;rsquo;s where things get interesting!</description>

      <description>(disclaimer) This blog post comes from an email I&amp;rsquo;ve sent to a couple of my friends who were looking into product management. After many people shared it I though it could be useful to random people who wanted to get to know what PM was about. It would need to be updated and it&amp;rsquo;s in French. I&amp;rsquo;ll update that asap I promise ü§û
Ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai fait perso ce n&amp;rsquo;est absolument pas une v√©rit√© absolue, c&amp;rsquo;est essayer de me cr√©er une culture produit sur tout ce qui passe sous mon nez.</description>

Started from the bottom&amp;hellip; Heetch is one of Uber&amp;rsquo;s French competitor. Basically the app offers a more social and fun experience than what Uber can offer with a very premium, high end service.
I joined in January 2018 as a Junior Ride Product Manager with Walid Ellec as a mentor. During those first months I shipped my first user facing features and started getting ahead of what being a PM meant.</description>

      <description>Status Side project üöß November 2017 - &amp;hellip;
Intro I&amp;rsquo;d say that project mixes two of the most important things I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered in my whole life: rap music and education. For those of you who already read a bit about my previous Deepdives project this is basically the personal spinoff I made from it. For the others, let&amp;rsquo;s meet below.

Intro This is part 2 (and last) of my entrepreneurial adventure with the amazing Charlotte Moreau. The first part is our attempt at launching Nabu&amp;rsquo;s sign language translation wristband.
After Class This project&amp;rsquo;s objective was pretty simple: how could one keep learning about new subjects without being feeling old-school-taught or bored?
We started with a first iteration as a messenger bot called Charade (try it out üá´üá∑).</description>

Intro This article is the first part of a 2 article-long adventure with the amazing Charlotte Moreau. I will write a dedicated article about the human adventure itself but let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the product and achievements for now.
Go Bears! When I left Paris for UC Berkeley (with a bricked computed) I never knew the &amp;ldquo;Jedi wristband&amp;rdquo; project I was bringing with me would follow such an amazing path.</description>

      <description>My name is Rashad but you already knew that, didn&amp;rsquo;t you? Basically I&amp;rsquo;m a product addict. I love digging around into all sort of fun and incredible products I can find. From the ones I use everyday to my friends&amp;rsquo; startup projects or even low tech random hardware from the 90s&amp;rsquo; I find on the streets, every product has something to teach us so let&amp;rsquo;s find out!
I&amp;rsquo;m always eager to collaborate with new people on new (or old) subjects to deliver great value to people in the world.</description>
