      <description>card 7 months to launch a web-app to help people learn about tomorrow key subjects.
Started as a messenger bot called Charade. Pivoted to aim at companies&amp;rsquo; employees to train them, with the help of research chairs, on high-impact subjects such as AI, circular economy, IoT ‚Ä¶
expand We started this project because of the recommandation problem we face. Everybody is always flooded into content (articles, videos, musics&amp;hellip;) that follow the same stupid principle: you liked it once, you&amp;rsquo;ll want more and more and more and more of it.</description>

      <description>card 4 months startup working on a sign language translation wristband.
Started the project when in UC Berkeley. Back in Paris the customer interviews showed us this was not the right solution to this problem.
expand This project was originally borned as the jedi wristband where we wanted to interact with our environment using only gestures. We soon realised that if we wanted to build some solid ventures the gadget could not be the main value proposition.</description>

      <description>WTF üëã My name is Rashad but you already knew that, didn&amp;rsquo;t you? I&amp;rsquo;m in the biggest pivot of my professional life from launching my own startup to joining a new incredible team. I&amp;rsquo;m very social, team-focused and goal-oriented. I believe I&amp;rsquo;m demanding towards myself and others. I want to make a real impact and dive 100% into my (our) next adventure.
On the other side, I&amp;rsquo;m also a positive and optimistic person who loves spending good moments with my loved ones.</description>
