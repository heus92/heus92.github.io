      <h1>üå† A Product Vision</h1>
    </header>

    

<p>There are a lot of people talking about product out there. Like a lot. How do you know I&rsquo;m the one you need for your amazing secret project? Well let me introduce you to <strong>my</strong> product vision.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-f-is-product-anyway">What the f*** is &ldquo;product&rdquo; anyway?</h3>

<p>Basically <strong>anything you&rsquo;re serving</strong> your users is product-related. The obvious part is made of UX and UI design of course but not only, your tech stack and the way you use your data (if any) change make go from a meh product to a great product!</p>

<p><img src="https://welcometothe.sale/images/wtf.gif" alt="what the fuck" /></p>

<p>A good product guy (or woman) should, in my opinion, be able to <strong>pull off at least 30% to 50% of any of her stakeholders&rsquo; job</strong> ranging from designers to data analysts to operational managers and engineers. Not saying she should tho ‚òùÔ∏è The ultimate goal is for one to be able to hold a relevant conversation with each of her stakeholders about <em>their</em> job to help them solve <em>their</em> issues.</p>

<h3 id="ok-cool-now-what">Ok cool, now what?</h3>

<p>Well now let&rsquo;s roll! A product-person&rsquo;s main objective is not to ship shiny features but to <strong>have impact on her users&rsquo; lives</strong>. Sure often this means going through tech-driven features but, one must not forget that operations-driven solutions are a great way to <strong>test and experiment an idea</strong> to measure its full potential before going into dev, even for a simple MVP.</p>

<p>Product people&rsquo;s duties don&rsquo;t stop when a feature has been shipped out in the world. Ideally, one should have defined success KPIs and built in a way to <strong>measure the feature&rsquo;s impact on users&rsquo; lives</strong> beforehand. However, we all know that things tend to go south more than they should. So even when that&rsquo;s the case, one should be able to find a way to <strong>identify a &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; proxy</strong> to get some insights on what&rsquo;s happening out there.</p>

<h3 id="you-re-not-alone">You&rsquo;re not alone!</h3>

<p>When a product folk is working within a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=RD4GK1NDTWbkY&amp;time_continue=11&amp;v=4GK1NDTWbkY">squad</a> or with another organization they have brilliant teammates alongside them. Not only should they rely on them, they have to empower them as well.</p>

<p>Product folds are among the very few people who have a global overview of what&rsquo;s happening and more importantly <strong>why</strong> it&rsquo;s happening. Share this context with your designers and engineers! Soon enough they&rsquo;ll be empowering you in finding the best solutions to deliver value to your users.</p>

<h3 id="the-end">The End.</h3>

<p>You certain don&rsquo;t agree with most of what has been said above. And you&rsquo;re right! We all have our own personalities and approach to product management. I&rsquo;m eager to discover new point of views on those topics so please let&rsquo;s chat and share. I&rsquo;m <a href="https://calendly.com/rashad-karanouh/coffee">available here</a> for a coffee IRL in Paris or for a visio call.</p>
