      <description>There are a lot of people talking about product out there. Like a lot. How do you know I&amp;rsquo;m the one you need for your amazing secret project? Well let me introduce you to my product vision.
What the f*** is &amp;ldquo;product&amp;rdquo; anyway? Basically anything you&amp;rsquo;re serving your users is product-related. The obvious part is made of UX and UI design of course but not only, your tech stack and the way you use your data (if any) change make go from a meh product to a great product!</description>

      <title>ðŸ‘¶ Product Management Starter Pack</title>
      <link>https://welcometothe.sale/articles/pm-starter-pack/</link>

      <description>(disclaimer) This blog post comes from an email I&amp;rsquo;ve sent to a couple of my friends who were looking into product management. After many people shared it I though it could be useful to random people who wanted to get to know what PM was about. It would need to be updated and it&amp;rsquo;s in French. I&amp;rsquo;ll update that asap I promise ðŸ¤ž
Ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai fait perso ce n&amp;rsquo;est absolument pas une vÃ©ritÃ© absolue, c&amp;rsquo;est essayer de me crÃ©er une culture produit sur tout ce qui passe sous mon nez.</description>
